> *“Torture the data long enough, and it will confess to anything.”* — **Ronald Coase**

I’m a Data Scientist at Globo, working on Cartola — Brazil’s largest fantasy football game, with millions of passionate users. I help turn massive amounts of data into relevant analysis, smart predictions, and insights that support meaningful decisions.

My work is driven by the goal of giving data a voice: connecting numbers to stories that help products evolve and teams better understand user behavior. I have experience in machine learning, predictive modeling, and exploratory analysis, and I’m constantly improving my technical and analytical abilities.

I believe that good data tells good stories — and good stories lead to confident decisions. If you'd like to talk about data or build something together, feel free to connect on LinkedIn.
